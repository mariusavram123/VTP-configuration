The goal of this project is to configure VTP(VLAN Trunking Protocol), using a 3-switches topology.
This lab has been build using the GNS3 network emulator.

Objectives:

- Configure the links between the switches as trunks and disable DTP
- Configure SW1 and SW2 in VTP server mode
- Configure SW3 in VTP client mode
- Configure the VTP domain as ENCOR on all switches
- Configure the VTP password as S3cret on all switches
- Enable VTP pruning
- Set the VTP version to 2
